# Number-plate-detection
Number Plate Detection of Vehicles using computer vision and deep learning techniques.the development of an automated system for detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates, addressing challenges such as varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and different plate formats.
Key Highlights:
- Skills Covered: Python, OpenCV, Streamlit, Computer Vision
- Domain: Traffic & Transport Control
- Problem Statement: Manual identification of vehicle plates is time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates the process to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and reliability.
- Business Use Cases:- Traffic management and law enforcement
- Automated toll collection and parking systems
- Fleet tracking and security monitoring
- Urban planning and analytics

Technical Approach:
- Data Collection & Preprocessing: Image acquisition, augmentation, and filtering
- Model Training: YOLO-based object detection for real-time plate recognition
- OCR Integration: Tesseract/EasyOCR for extracting alphanumeric text
- Deployment: Streamlit-based web application for user-friendly access

Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Average Precision (mAP) for detection accuracy
- Intersection over Union (IoU) for bounding box evaluation
- OCR text accuracy and inference speed

Project Deliverables:
- Trained YOLO model, preprocessed dataset, and Streamlit web application
- Performance report, code repository, and deployment guide
- Demo video showcasing real-world implementation

This document serves as a detailed guide for developers, researchers, and professionals interested in computer vision applications for automated vehicle identification.
